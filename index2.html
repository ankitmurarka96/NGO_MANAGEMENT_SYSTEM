<h5 class="card-title">What a young girl told when asked about
<p class="card-text">I always thought it was better to receive than to give, but when my family went to donate clothes and other items to the homeless shelter, I realized that it’s better to give than to receive. One year ago we went to the homeless shelter in Norwich and donated toys and clothes. It was my birthday and my parents wanted me to donate all of the clothing that I had outgrown as well as toys I no longer played with. I didn’t really mind because the new toys I got for my birthday were better, especially one in particular.

<h5 class="card-title">Losing yourself in serving others</h5>
<p class="card-text">“The most sublime act is to set another before you.” Spoken by English poet William Blake, this quote reveals what I believe is a very important – if not the most important – thing a person can do. Putting others first involves the laying aside of our own interests and then willingly doing something for another person's benefit. This task, however, is not an easy one to perform; human nature itself has the tendency to focus on self-related matters. If we are to put others before ourselves, then we must break away from that egotistical way of thinking and consider the value of other people and their lives.</p>

<h5 class="card-title">Why Charity is Significant</h5>
<p class="card-text">donations to charity give you the opportunity to meet new people and increase your circle of acquaintances. This is particularly true when you give and share with your time, experience or expertise to a worthy reason. While most charitable organizations and project usually require money, some would not operate without the army of volunteers. Whether you abandon your time one day a week to serve meals, make a couple of minutes a chance to sit with the elderly or travel overseas to help build homes, you can surely meet many like-minded people along this way. </p>
